About ten years ago I was on looking round a grand country estate called Castle Ward in Northern Ireland.  You may have seen it on Game of Thrones as Winterfell Castle. It was a very bright sunny day, early afternoon. I was with my wife and mother in law and we were up near an odd little building in the grounds, a type of old tower. The wind coming off the shore was quite cold, so we sat down in the lee of this building and rested for a bit. My wife and her mother were chatting about gardening or something, and as I turned to look at them to join in the conversation a figure walked between me and them and quickly disappeared. I can' describe it only as a figure, possibly male, wearing a great coat with large buttons down the sides. There was little of it, like a very badly faded old photograph. I could not make out a head, and the image was faded below the knees. It was only there for a few moments in bright sunlight, passing between me and my wife who were perhaps eighteen inches apart. It was so unexpected that I inadvertently blurted out I think I have just seen a ghost.`, userId: 3, questionId: 1, createdAt: '2021-02-20', updatedAt: '2021-02-20'},

As I recall, only one of them came to the party, so most of the attendees were not close friends. \r\n Her mother picked us up in a rickety old van. All of us. Their house was old, on a huge lot. There were two little outbuildings on the property- a shed and an old outhouse. We all laughed about the outhouse, since there was no reason for it to exist (yes, this was in the late 70s, but indoor plumbing had been a thing for quite some time!) \r\n Summer had a little sister named Autumn who was about 3. We joked about their names- if her mom had another kid, would it be Winter? \r\n I don't remember much about the party. I know we all ran around, played in the outbuildings, and asked Summer about her life. She had only been at our school for a few weeks, and she said her mom moved around a lot but wanted Summer to make some new friends, which is why she invited a bunch of girls she didn't know to her house. Being 11 year old girls, we all immediately pledged to be her very best friends. \r\n Her mom took us all home the next day. \r\n On Monday, I didn't see Summer. I asked my friend who had been at the sleepover if she had seen Summer. Nope. Maybe she was sick? \r\n A few days went by, and no Summer. I asked one of the other girls who had been at the party if she had seen our new friend. She looked at me in puzzlement. “Summer? I don't know anyone named Summer.” Okayyyy.? Didn't we all say she was our new best friend? How fickle can you be?  \r\n A few days later, I was in the car with my mom, and we drove by the street where Summer lived. I said, “That's where I was last weekend.” I started to point, and then it hit me. \r\n There was no house there. No green house, no outbuildings. Nothing but a field of grass. \r\n I was trying to convince my mother that a house had stood there a week ago, and she pointed out that there was no rubble. No sign of a house. And there hadn't been a house in that location as far as she could remember. \r\n Since none of the parents had dropped off or picked up their daughters, there was no one who could verify the house's existence. And aside from my one friend, no one else acknowledged that they had been there. No one at school remembered ever knowing Summer.  \r\n I don't know if this qualifies as paranormal, but it sure as hell wasn't normal!`, userId: 14, questionId: 9, createdAt: '2020-02-21', updatedAt: '2020-02-21'},

And what I've come to know, is that every soul that crosses over chooses how they “show up” in physical form. \r\n My paternal grandmother Bertha passed away in her late 80s but always shows up as a vibrant 55 year old. Her hair is black and curled and her figure is curvy and youthful. At the time of her transition, she has been bed-bound for years following a series of strokes. \r\n My maternal grandfather Reyes, passed away in his late 70s from Parkinson's. When I channel him, he appears in the body of a 40 year old. His body is slim and strong like the rugged Cowboy he was in his hay day. Before he passed and lost the ability to speak, these were the years he most relived.\r\n And like these examples, many of the Spirits that I connect with choose how they show up. Rarely are they sickly in appearance. If they passed on from an illness, they are now resplendent. These encounters with Spirit give me and their loved ones great joy and assurance that Heaven indeed is a place of transformation. \r\n\ Thank you for your question.
